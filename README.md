## GPU RENDERING

A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a chip or electronic circuit capable of rendering graphics for display on an electronic device.o rTo render something, by definition, is to bring it to life. 


In reference to websites and webapps such as google, rendering involves converting static code stored on web servers into javascriopt, HTML and CSS which translates into search bars, buttons and other user interface components that the user can interact with on the screen as designed by the web designer and web developer.

GPU  rendering is used to accelerate the displaying and rendering of web contents in a web browser. Modern web broswers delegate certain tasks from the CPU to GPU. This includes rendering complex graphics, animations and 3D text.

When you open a web page, your browser reads the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to build the webpage's structure and display its content. GPU rendering helps speed up this process by moving some tasks, like combining images, applying textures, and processing visual effects, from the computer's main processor to its graphics card. This helps make the webpage load faster and ensures that animations appear smoother. 

GPU rendering makes it possible to use your graphics card for rendering, instead of the CPU. This can speed up rendering because modern GPUs are designed to do quite a lot of number crunching.
